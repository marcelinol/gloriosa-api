# Gloriosa API

This is a project for me to study GraphQL.
It is an API that responds with the current time (in `(GMT-03:00) Brasilia`) in "the Faustao format": How many minutes until 8:07 or how many minutes have past from 8:07.
This is no real standard, it was just created for fun. [Watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOAYPmmxV9M) to understand where this comes from.

# Interactive interface

You can play with the GraphQL API and read its docs [here](https://gloriosa-api.herokuapp.com/graphiql)
